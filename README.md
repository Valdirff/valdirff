## ðŸ§  About Me

Electrical Engineer graduated from IFSC and currently pursuing a master's degree in Biomedical Engineering at UFSC, where I focus on developing technologies for healthcare. My main interest lies in **research and development (R&D)**, exploring the intersection of **engineering, AI, and neuroscience** to create innovative solutions in the biomedical field.

Over the course of my academic and research trajectory, I've worked on projects that integrate **AI with biomedical and clinical engineering**, addressing real-world challenges such as **adverse event analysis**, **homecare optimization**, and **medical diagnostics**. My experience spans from **signal processing** (vibration and biosignals), to the application of **DL models** for image classification. I've also been developing **web APIs and mobile applications**, alongside exploring early MLOps practices to make AI pipelines reproducible and deployable within healthcare contexts.

My current research involves the study and development of **neuromorphic models and algorithms** inspired by brain function, using frameworks such as **Intel's Lava** for real-time and energy-efficient biomedical applications.
