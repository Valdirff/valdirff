## ðŸ§  About Me

Electrical Engineer graduated from IFSC and currently pursuing a master's degree in Biomedical Engineering at UFSC, where I focus on developing technologies for healthcare. My main interest lies in **research and development (R&D)**, exploring the intersection of **engineering, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience** to create innovative solutions in the biomedical field.

With over three years of experience at **TeraSolar**, I gained solid expertise in solar energy and technical project execution. However, it was through discovering the transformative power of **machine learning applied to healthcare** that I redirected my career path toward tech-driven impact in the health sector.

My current research involves the study and development of **neuromorphic models and algorithms** inspired by brain function, using frameworks such as **Intel's Lava** for real-time and energy-efficient biomedical applications.
